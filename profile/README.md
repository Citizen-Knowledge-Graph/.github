# âœ¨ FÃ¶rderFunke âœ¨

Our active repositories explained. These power our web app:

- `foerderfunke-react-app` The web app, live at [foerderfunke.org](https://foerderfunke.org) ðŸ™Œ
- `knowledge-base` Contains all the knowledge being used in the web app.
- `matching-engine` Gets instructed by the web app to match `knowledge-base` content against the user profile.
- `sem-ops-utils` Bundles libs and provides utils to `matching-engine` and `console`. Used for tests in `matching-engine`.

These are tools we built to help us with data modeling:
- `shacl-generator` AI-playground to create SHACL shapes from text
- `console` semOps: a linked data operations flow tool
